<h1> Responsive one page website for Dental Services </h1>

<p> In this folder are the source files for the responsive one page website built by me for the Dental Services Company. </p>
<p> The design and layout was done in Photoshop and then coded. </p>
<p> For the simplicity I used Bootstrap CSS framework. </p>
<p> There were a few lines of JavaScript code to take care of the arrow-up at the bottom of the page to return to the top </p>
<p> I published the tutorial how to build the one page responsive website and used this example. </p>
